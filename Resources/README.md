## Overview

### Background
Roza is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Roza's role is to discover and document these bacteria. In particular, Rosa is interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup, to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success synthesizing meet from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. 

However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the illusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. Rosa has a hypothesis that there is a microorganism that can supply the next best taste and she believes it can be found quit close to home from bacteria found on the human body. Here is what Rosa knows so far: the human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria and different parts of the body harbor different species and bacteria found in the gut are not the same speciies that are found on a person's eyelashes. Furthermore, between individuals, the bacterial species may vary even in the same location

Rosa hypothesises that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button or at least in someone's belly button. To test her hypothesis, Rosa has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person's identigy is anonymous. They have instead been assigned an id number. Now Rosa wants to build a dashboard that both her research participants and fellow researchers can access. Those who participated in the study, will be able to visit a website and select their id numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navals. Who knows what they might find! 

### Purpose
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

**When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940's data should be displayed in the dashboard, and the three charts should be working according to their requirements...
