### Overview

## Background 
Last summer you and your friend Kate, took the trip of a lifetime, NYC for two full weeks, exploring historical landmarks like central park, the statue of liberty, and the empire state building. It was a magical experience and as you flew home together, you looked through your vacation photos and had a realization. 
One of the key ingredients to the magic was an unlikely suspect, Citi bike. You and Kate had biked everywhere, which allowed you to really get to know the city and interact with the people who live there, and who are using bikes for their commutes. A gem of an idea starts to form in your mind, what if you could start a similar bike share business in your hometown of Damion, Iowa. 
You and Kate start brainstorming, and a few weeks later she calls you with some incredible news. She has a potential angel investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to explore a bike share program in Damion. This is an exciting prospect, but you know you have to think realistically. Mechanics of making this business work might be quite different in Damion than in the city. Your first step is to figure out exactly how the bike share business works in NYC. From there, you will create a proposal on how this will work in Damion. 

## Purpose
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

### What You're Creating

- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format



- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

Charts 1-5 as required in this deliverable can be viewed below in Deliverable 3

- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

a) overview/purpose of analysis
This challenege was designed to showcase the Tableau skills we learned and to create an analysis on bike usage in New York City for August 2019 in order to make assumptions on how a potential bike share app would work in Des Moines, Iowa. Visualizations were created and put into a Tableau story to be presented to investors.
